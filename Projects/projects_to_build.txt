1. Minor Projects (small but mighty, warm-up your fingers)
These should take like a few hours to a day max if you stay focused.

10	Image Slider	Auto/manual image slider with arrows.
Goal: Get your brain quick with DOM, Events, Loops, Conditionals.

2. Medium Projects (you're cooking now, these hit harder)
These will take 2–5 days depending on complexity and polish.

10	Drawing App	Canvas-based simple paint app.

3. Major Projects (final boss fights)
These will take 1-2+ weeks to polish properly if you go beast mode.
This is where you build real resume pieces — no more "cute projects."


#	Project Idea	Description
1	Professional Portfolio Website (MANDATORY)	Your home on the internet. Multiple pages (Home, Projects, About, Contact), animations, responsiveness, smooth scroll, sticky nav, hero sections, testimonial section, contact form. Build it like you're applying to Google — no shortcuts.
2	E-Commerce Product Store (Frontend Only)	Product cards grid, filters (category, price), single product page, cart functionality (add, remove, view), checkout page. Use localStorage to save cart data. No backend — fake it till you make it.
3	Blogging Website	Create, display, and delete posts stored in localStorage. Show blog posts dynamically, beautiful typography, featured post banner.
4	Job Board	Users can filter jobs by location/type (remote, part-time, etc.). Maybe later connect it to a fake API like jsonplaceholder if you wanna flex harder.
Goal: Deep dive into responsive design, modular code, project architecture, user experience (UX), and make things look clean AF.
