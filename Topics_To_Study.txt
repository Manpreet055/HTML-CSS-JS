Topics to Study (Sorted by Priority):

1. Event Handling (Weak Area)
   - stopPropagation() and preventDefault().
   - Event capturing vs. bubbling.
   - Custom events (CustomEvent).

2. Event Delegation (Weak Area)
   - Correct usage of event.target and event.currentTarget.
   - Handling child and parent elements properly.

3. Asynchronous JavaScript
   - Promises: then, catch, and finally.
   - async/await for cleaner asynchronous code.
   - Event loop and how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.
   - Fetch API for making HTTP requests.

4. Debouncing and Throttling
   - Debouncing: Delaying function execution to reduce event frequency.
   - Throttling: Limiting function execution to a fixed interval.

5. Mutation Observers
   - Watching for changes in the DOM.

6. JavaScript Modules
   - import and export syntax.
   - Default vs. named exports.
   - How to use modules in modern JavaScript projects.

7. Browser APIs
   - Storage APIs: LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and Cookies.
   - Geolocation API: Accessing user location.
   - Notifications API: Sending browser notifications.
   - WebSockets: Real-time communication.
   - Canvas API: Drawing graphics on the web.

8. Error Handling and Debugging
   - try...catch and finally for error handling.
   - Using console effectively for debugging.
   - Debugging tools in the browser (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
   - Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).

9. Functional Programming
   - Pure functions and immutability.
   - Higher-order functions in depth.
   - Currying and partial application.
   - Composition of functions.

10. Build Tools
    - Webpack, Parcel, or Vite for bundling JavaScript.
    - Babel for transpiling modern JavaScript.
    - ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.

11. Build a Project
    - Apply what youâ€™ve learned by building projects like:
      - A to-do list with local storage.
      - A weather app using the Fetch API.
      - A real-time chat app using WebSockets.
