8. Advanced Concepts in Asynchronous Programming

âœ… Microtasks vs Macrotasks (Event Loop)
   - Learn how JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks using the event loop.
   - Understand the difference between microtasks (e.g., Promises) and macrotasks (e.g., setTimeout).

âœ… Async Generators
   - Learn how to use async generators to handle streams of asynchronous data.
   - Useful for processing large datasets or real-time data.

âœ… Web Workers
   - Learn how to use Web Workers to run JavaScript code in the background without blocking the main thread.
   - Useful for handling CPU-intensive tasks in web applications.

âœ… Streams and Async Iteration
   - Learn how to work with streams in Node.js or the browser.
   - Useful for processing large files or real-time data incrementally.

9. Extra Topics to Explore

Debouncing and Throttling
   - Debouncing: Delaying function execution to reduce event frequency.
   - Throttling: Limiting function execution to a fixed interval.

Mutation Observers
   - Watching for changes in the DOM.
   - Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
   - Currying and partial application.


Browser APIs
   - Storage APIs: LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and Cookies.
   - Geolocation API: Accessing user location.
   - Notifications API: Sending browser notifications.
   - WebSockets: Real-time communication.
   - Canvas API: Drawing graphics on the web.
