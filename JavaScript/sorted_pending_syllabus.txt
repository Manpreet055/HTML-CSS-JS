Level 1: Fundamental Data Handling in the Browser
1. localStorage vs. sessionStorage (setItem, getItem, removeItem)
    Why? – You gotta start by understanding how browsers store data locally, whether for a session or persistently.

2. Storing arrays & objects using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()
    Why? – Once you’re into storage, learn to handle non-primitive data. Converting your arrays/objects so they can be stored/retrieved is key.

3. FormData for handling form inputs
    Why? – Forms are the lifeblood of user input. Get the fundamentals of packaging that data for easy submission to your server.

Level 2: Basic API Communication & CRUD Operations
4. Sending POST request (with headers and JSON)
    Why? – Now that you know data handling, it’s time to communicate with servers. Learn how to send data securely and correctly.

5. CRUD operations from frontend (forms + API = power combo)
    Why? – Master the basics of Create, Read, Update, Delete operations through form inputs and API interactions.

6. Axios (Alternative to fetch, with built-in error handling)
    Why? – Once you’re comfortable making requests, Axios can save you time and add a layer of built-in error handling to your work.

Level 3: API Security and Data Flow Enhancements
7. API Authentication (Bearer tokens, API keys)
    Why? – Before you go into heavy integrations, get a grip on securing your API endpoints and communications.

8. Pagination (load more button, infinite scroll)
    Why? – Efficient data fetching is crucial. Pagination helps manage large datasets and boosts performance.

9. Rate limiting & Retry mechanisms
    Why? – Learn the tactics to avoid blowing your API quotas and ensure smooth user experiences when errors occur.

Level 4: Advanced DOM Observers
10. MutationObserver (detect real-time changes in the DOM)
     Why? – Up your game by reacting to DOM mutations as they happen—crucial for dynamic single-page apps.

11. IntersectionObserver (detect if an element is visible)
     Why? – Perfect for lazy loading images or triggering animations when elements enter the viewport.

12. ResizeObserver (track element size changes)
     Why? – Keep tabs on element dimension changes to maintain responsive and well-adapted layouts.

Level 5: Performance Optimization & Advanced Asynchronous Patterns
13. Debouncing & Throttling (optimize frequent events like scrolling)
     Why? – Stop your app from going haywire by learning to control the frequency of event-triggered functions.

14. requestAnimationFrame() for smooth animations
     Why? – Essential for creating buttery-smooth animations by syncing them with your browser’s rendering cycle.

15. Using documentFragment to batch multiple DOM updates
     Why? – Optimize performance by minimizing reflows and repaints when updating the DOM.

16. Converting Callbacks to Promises (Promisification)
     Why? – Modernize your asynchronous code. Promises clean up callback hell and pave the way for async/await.

17. Microtasks vs Macrotasks (Event Loop)
     Why? – Getting a grip on the event loop is key to understanding how JavaScript handles asynchronous code execution.

18. Async Generators
     Why? – They’re the advanced tool in your asynchronous toolbox for handling data streams over time.

19. Web Workers
     Why? – Offload heavy computations off the main thread to keep your UI snappy.

20. Streams and Async Iteration
     Why? – Handle continuous data flows with style by leveraging streams alongside async iteration for real-time data processing.
